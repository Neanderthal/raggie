## üî∞ FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Prefer EAFP over LBYL**

- **EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission)**: Do the operation and handle exceptions if they arise.
    
- **LBYL (Look Before You Leap)**: Check all possible conditions before acting ‚Äî but this is more error-prone and can introduce race conditions.
    

> ‚úÖ _Use EAFP when interacting with external systems or resources._

## üîç CATEGORIZE EVERY EXCEPTION

### 2. **Classify Exceptions by Origin**

- **New Error**: Created by your own code due to internal validation or business logic.
    
- **Bubbled-up Error**: Raised from a lower-level function that your code called.
    

### 3. **Classify Exceptions by Recoverability**

- **Recoverable**: You know how to fix it and can continue.
    
- **Non-Recoverable**: You can't fix it ‚Äî propagate it up.

## üîÑ 4 TYPES OF EXCEPTION HANDLING (The Matrix)

|Type|Action to Take|
|---|---|
|üÜï New + ‚úÖ Recoverable|Fix internally, continue|
|üîÅ Bubbled-up + ‚úÖ Recoverable|Catch, fix, continue|
|üÜï New + ‚ùå Non-Recoverable|Raise a new exception|
|üîÅ Bubbled-up + ‚ùå Non-Recoverable|**Let it bubble up**|

## ‚öôÔ∏è TACTICAL GUIDELINES

### 4. **Never Catch What You Can‚Äôt Handle**

- Avoid `except Exception` or `except:` unless you‚Äôre at the **top-level boundary** of your app.
    
- Catch **specific exception classes** that you're explicitly prepared to deal with.
    

### 5. **Use Custom Exceptions When Appropriate**

- Create meaningful exception classes like `ValidationError`, `DatabaseUnavailableError`, etc.
    

```python
class ValidationError(Exception):
    pass
```

---

## üí° BEST PRACTICES BY SCENARIO

### 6. **Top-Level Exception Catching**

- Only here is catching all exceptions acceptable ‚Äî for logging, cleanup, and graceful exit.
    

```python
try:
    main()
except Exception as e:
    log(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

### 7. **Use Frameworks‚Äô Exception Handling**

- **Flask, Django, FastAPI** etc. provide global handlers. Let them handle low-level exceptions.
    
- Avoid per-view/manual exception catching unless recovery is meaningful.
    

### 8. **Design for Separation of Concerns**

- Avoid mixing error handling and UI/UX concerns.
    
- Let exceptions bubble to a higher layer that knows how to present the issue.

## üß™ ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC HANDLING

### 9. **Different Behaviors for Dev and Prod**

```python
if mode == "development":
    raise
else:
    log(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

> ‚ùóÔ∏èCrashes during development are helpful ‚Äî don‚Äôt hide them!

---

## üìã CODE CLEANLINESS AND LOGGING

### 10. **Use `logger.exception()` not `logger.error()`**

- `logger.exception()` auto-includes the stack trace.
    

### 11. **Avoid Redundant Error Handling**

- Don‚Äôt catch and log an error just to re-raise it.
    

### 12. **Let Frameworks Handle Common Patterns**

- E.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy handles rollbacks automatically after exceptions ‚Äî no need for manual rollback logic in every route.
    

---

## üîí RARELY OKAY PRACTICES

### 13. **When Catching All Exceptions Is Acceptable**

- **CLI app main()**
    
- **Event loop/tkinter/GUI handlers**
    
- **Background jobs or async workers**
    

---

## üß† MENTAL MODELS

### 14. **Think in Terms of State Correction**

- If the state can be corrected, don‚Äôt raise ‚Äî fix and move on.
    
- If it cannot, raise immediately with relevant context.
    

### 15. **Exceptions Are Contracts**

- Make functions raise predictable, documented exceptions.
    
- Don't use exceptions for control flow unless unavoidable.

## ‚úÖ CHECKLIST BEFORE RAISING OR CATCHING

-  Is this a new error or a bubbled-up one?
    
-  Can I recover from it here?
    
-  Am I catching the most specific exception class?
    
-  Will this error need to be logged?
    
-  Do I understand the framework‚Äôs error lifecycle?
    
-  Am I in development or production mode?
